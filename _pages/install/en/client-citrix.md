Terminal servers are made for __an average work load__ and are dependent on applications to release their resources as fast as possible when disconnecting from the RDP session. A client in normal configuration would stay in the memory and prevent the session from being closed completely, since the client is also serving as a server for the add-ins.

The setting __ShutdownOnDisconnect__ in OneOffixx.exe instructs the client to shut down automatically as soon as __Session Disconnect__ reaches it. This may be noticed by the user when OneOffixx starts again in the background after every __Session Start__.

```xml
  <configuration>
    <configSections>
    <appSettings>
      <!-- Allows to configure OneOffixx to shutdown 
           when a disconnect happens (such as disconnecting from an RDP Session) -->
      <add key="ShutdownOnDisconnect" value="true" />
    </appSettings>
  </configuration>
```

This setting can be adjusted in the [Setup]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/en/client/#msi) through the UI or a parameter.

It must be assured that every OneOffixx client has its own exclusive access to the cache in the __Load Balanced__ Terminal Server environment. This can be ensured through the correct supply of the [cache folder]({{ site.baseurl }}/install/en/client/#install).

Another option is to exclude the OneOffixx client from __Active State__ monitoring in the terminal server.
